Project Description
===================
Providing a GUI that searches torrent indexing or torrent provider websites and brings back movies
Currently the projet is hooked into the YIFY provider site. This project was originally developed for 
school for demonstration and spirited debate. I'm presenting it here to continue building on it but for others to learn from it.

Alot to fix but majority is functional and IT DOES work

This application does use P2P protocol and is powered through MonoTorrent. For communicating to YIFY it uses Newtonsoft JSON library. If its slow to download then give it a few minutes it'll warm up. It just needs to connect to the swarm and all the seeders
